# Air-Pollution-Monitoring-using-IOT
This is IOT based Air Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor air quality over webserver using Internet and MQ135 gas sensor.
Air pollution monitoring using an MQ135 gas sensor and integrating it over a webserver can be achieved using the following steps:
Requirements:
*MQ135 gas sensor
*Arduino board
*Wi-Fi module
*Breadboard and jumper wires
*Power supply
->Connect the MQ135 gas sensor to the Arduino board using the breadboard and jumper wires. Make sure to connect the sensor's pins to the correct Arduino pins.

->Connect the Wi-Fi module to the Arduino board using the breadboard and jumper wires. Follow the instructions provided by the module's datasheet to establish a Wi-Fi connection.

->Write the code to read the data from the MQ135 sensor and send it over the Wi-Fi connection to the webserver. This code can be written in the Arduino IDE using the appropriate libraries for the MQ135 sensor and the Wi-Fi module.

->Create a web server to receive and display the data. This can be done using a scripting language such as PHP or Python and a web framework such as Flask or Django.

->Configure the web server to receive the data sent from the Arduino board and display it on the web page.

->Test the setup by monitoring the air pollution levels using the MQ135 sensor and verifying that the data is being correctly transmitted to the web server and displayed on the web page.

->Overall, this project requires knowledge of electronics, programming, and web development. It can be a great learning opportunity for individuals interested in these areas.
